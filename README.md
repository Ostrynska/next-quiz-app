This is a quiz application that tests users' knowledge of certain issues. When a user starts a quiz, the app displays the total number of questions and the question they are currently answering. You can answer only once without changing your answer, as when selecting an answer, the program shows whether it is correct or not. Clicking on the ‘Next’ button opens the next question. Below the button, there is a panel displaying which questions we have answered and our answers in colour depending on the selected answer.
